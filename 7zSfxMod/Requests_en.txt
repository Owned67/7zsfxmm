Ya158:
When using the module, you can display the progress bar of file distribution.
If the executable files are then run using RunProgram, the progress bar is not displayed.
Therefore, it may appear that the installation has already ended, although the executable files are still working.
Is it possible to make sure that when running executable files using RunProgram would be displayed
A window with the inscription "Wait for the installation to finish" without the buttons and the ability to close it.

I need to run exe with different keys,
Cmd behaves chaotically when starting from a network folder,
For this I exe myself squeezed 7z (then my installer is first decompressed into a temporary folder, and run, but locally) and in the way I appended keys, which is terribly inconvenient.
Is it possible to add buttons in sfx to execute different installation scripts?

There is a request: add additional RunPreSetup and RunPostSetup commands,
Which would be launched at the very beginning of the module (the first command)
And at the very end (the last team) in any case,
Are RunPrograms and AutoInstall available?
